# Club Hunts

The Otago Deerstalkers Branch holds Club Hunts for Members.

Each year would typically see two main Club Hunts - one for goats, and another for deer.

In addition we may hold a tahr hunt, a wallaby hunt, etc. - as interest and opportunity permit.

Occasionally we hold hunts where we either host another NZDA branch, or are hosted by another NZDA branch - again, as interest and opportunity permit.
