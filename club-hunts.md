# Club Hunts

The Otago Deerstalkers Association holds Club Hunts for Members.

Each year would typically see two main Club Hunts - one for goats, and another for Deer.

In addition we may hold a Thar hunt, a Wallaby hunt, etc. - as interest and opportunity permit.

Occasionally we hold hunts where we either host another NZDA branch, or are hosted by another NZDA branch - again, as interest and opportunity permit.
