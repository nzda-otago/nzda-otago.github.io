HUNTS was first launched in 1987 and has seen thousands of hunters gain the skills needed to hunt safely and responsibly in New Zealand.


Learn about hunting and the outdoors with an instructor who has a proven level of 
competence through a national training and assessment package. Your instructor will 
pass on their experience and knowledge in hunting following the hunting guidelines 
of NZDA and Fish and Game NZ. For more information see the syllabus.


The New Zealand Deerstalkers’ Association (NZDA) promotes hunting as a lifetime outdoor activity through the Hunter National Training Scheme (HUNTS).


The HUNTS covers the knowledge and skills to operate safely as a hunter in the New Zealand outdoors and teaches the ethics of fair chase and the principles of managing a sustainable game resource.

The course is delivered over 16 hours of theory and 4 field days including at least 1 overnight camping trip.


Further information will be released soon, however the HUNTS Course attendance is a commitment. There are limited slots, so those participating will be expected to turn up to all stages of the course.
